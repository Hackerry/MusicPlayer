This repository contains a light-weight music player implemented with JavaFX.
It supports normal music player functionalities (ie: import files, change progress and volume, etc). This program has some hard-coded parts, for example, different languages and charset converting in ID3 tags.
Overall it's functional and suitable for my daily use.
